/**
 Purpose
 ----
 
 It´s boring to write the init method again and again, especially there are
 many init mehods to overwrite. For example, if you want subclass UIView,
 you may overwrite ini, initWithFrame:, initWithColder:. And if you want
 subclass that class you also should overwrite these methods again, WTF.
 
 It´s time to end these meaningless repetition. By conforms to 
 RFInitializing, you can only write these init method in root class once,
 then in subclass you can only implement `onInit` and `afterInit`, no more
 init.
 
 Attention, if a class conforms to RFInitializing, `onInit` should be called
 during init and before init method return. But `afterInit` should called
 after the method finished which init was called in it usually. eg:
 
 @code

- (void)viewDidLoad {
    [super viewDidLoad];

    // RFButton conforms to RFInitializing.
    RFButton *button = [[RFButton alloc] init];
    // `onInit` was called before here.

    // Do some config.
    button.icon = [UIImage imageNamed:@"pic"];

    // Any other code.
    // `afterInit` won't be called in this scope.
}
// `afterInit` will be called after viewDidLoad executed in this example.

 @endcode
 
 
 Usage
 ----

 You should only call `onInit` and `afterInit` in root object which conforms
 to this protocol. And `afterInit` must be delayed. Here is a example:
 
 @code
 
- (id)init {
    self = [super init];
    if (self) {
        [self onInit];
        // Delay execute afterInit, you can also use GCD.
        [self performSelector:@selector(afterInit) withObject:self afterDelay:0];
    }
    return self;
}

 @endcode
 
 
 In subclass, you must not call these method in init method. You may 
 implemente onInit or afterInit for customize. And you should call super at
 some point in your implementation if you override onInit or afterInit. eg:
 
 @code

// If you had to add another init method.
- (id)initWithSomething:(id)some {
    self = [super init];
    if (self) {
        // Don't call onInit or afterInit.
        self.something = some;
    }
    return self;
}
 
- (void)onInit {
    [super onInit];
    // Something
}
 
- (void)afterInit {
    [super afterInit];
    // Something
}

 @endcode
